Tomcat – Mutual authentication over SSL

Steps to enable HTTPS in Tomcat and Configure Mutual authentication



Mutual authentication is a security process in which both client and server authenticate each other's identities before actual communication occurs.

Mutual authentication requires that both the server and the client prove their respective identities to each other before performing any communication-related functions.

In a web-based mutual authentication process, communication can occur only if the client and the server trust each other’s digital certificates. 

mutualAuth.sh script, here, will generate a server and the client self signed digital certificate and will authenticate the client to the server. 

After script runs successfully, it will show a XML connector string which you need to add to your Tomcat's server.xml file to enable HTTPS. 


It is mainly for development puposes.

Steps to enable HTTPS on Tomcat and Enable Mutual authentication : 
1. Download the script. 
2. Move the file to the location where you want to keep your certificates for e.g. : ~.cert
3. Go to a Terminal/ ssh client
```cd ~/.cert```
4. Make the script executable 
```chmod +x mutualAuth,sh```
5. Run the sript
```./certificate```
6. Enter your server store/ key password
7. Enter your client store/ key password
8. Say "yes" when it asks to import the certificate on to the server keystore.
9. Add/ Modify XML connector string in your Tomacat server.xml to enable HTTPS with mutual authentication. 


10. If you check the directory now (```ls -lart```), It should have genearetd certificates.
Import the client certificate in your browser.
